# Formatting Files for Input

At present, `kwak-gui-file` only works on files that are formatted
as plain text. For the most part, this means `.txt` files (e.g.
those created in notepad), as opposed to `.doc`, `.rtf`, `.docx`, etc...

It also doesn't work on files that contain a mixture of English and
Kwak'wala, as the program will try to parse the English text as
though it were Kwak'wala, and change it around. You can prevent this
by putting pipes (the character `|`) around English text, but that
can be time-consuming depending on the amount of English names/etc...
